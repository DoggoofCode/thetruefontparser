# Font Parser
## Goal
The goal for this project is to be able to integrate this font parser into a truely from scratch text editor made in *matplotlib* or pygame something along those lines I guess. I have made a local test with a bitmap font that looks ugly, so this is the next evolution, the **True Type Font**.
### To do
* Get all of the font formats (14 is currently the only one which will be supported)
* Get proper display data from all possible tables since that maybe possible is needed when creating a next editor
* "Graph" glyphs in Matplotlib
* GET THE GOD DAMN SPACE CHARACTER WORKING I AM GOING TO KILL WHO EVER DOCUMENTED THIS
